# FDO-Java
this is a MATLAB implementation of a novel swarm intelligent algorithm, known as the fitness dependent optimizer (FDO). The bee swarming reproductive process and their collective decision-making have inspired this algorithm; it has no algorithmic connection with the honey bee algorithm or the artificial bee colony algorithm. It is worth mentioning that FDO is considered a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm that updates the search agent position by adding velocity (pace). However, FDO calculates velocity differently; it uses the problem fitness function value to produce weights, and these weights guide the search agents during both the exploration and exploitation phases. FDO is tested on a group of 19 classical benchmark test functions, and the results are compared with three well-known algorithms: PSO, the genetic algorithm (GA), and the dragonfly algorithm (DA), additionally, FDO is tested on IEEE Congress of Evolutionary Computation Benchmark Test Functions (CEC-C06, 2019 Competition) The results are compared with three modern algorithms: (DA), the whale optimization algorithm (WOA), and the salp swarm algorithm (SSA). The FDO results show better performance in most cases and comparative results in other cases. implementation of the mentioned Benchmark function is exist in the code.
